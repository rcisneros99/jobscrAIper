      question: "How often are new jobs added?",
      answer: (
        <span>
          Never... and Always! 
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
          When you perform a search, our AI searches real-time for information directly from company websites. Unlike traditional job boards that store outdated listings, we don't maintain a purely static database. Instead, our advanced AI technology actively scrapes and analyzes company career pages the moment you search, ensuring you get the most current opportunities available. 
        <br></br>
        <br></br> 
          This means every search gives you fresh, up-to-the-minute results, and you'll never waste time applying to positions that are no longer open. Our platform can even detect when positions have been filled or removed, saving you valuable time in your job search. You can enable notifications to stay informed about new matches as they become available on company websites.
